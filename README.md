# TroubelShoting

The only problem that I get when I used two Grids.
while I used the left padding it was changing both grids even if they are separated with different classes and divs (named in my project class="conatiner1 " class="conatiner2" I thought that grids might affect each other but I was wrong the only problem was with the div for the elements inside the top class so as a conclusion make sure to put a width for each DIV)

# Contributions

You can download it and try to understand how the media queries and the grids also work, so far for this project, it doesn't need any changes but maybe we will work at the same idea in the future but not with a dummy data

Thanks, Best of luck
